# Python Perceptron

This application builds a perceptron, the simplest form of a neural network. This application uses set parameters to initialize the neural network and is fed training vector to build a model. The values of the training vector are used to adjust the parameters (weights and biases) of the model and the sum of the output is compared against the activation function (for logical OR) via a feed forward process. Based on our cost or error of the current iteration the model will iteratively update its weights and biases until the model has the lowest possible error. At this point the model is at its most accurate state and able to process test data.
